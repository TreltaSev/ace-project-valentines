### Learning Objectives

#### Learn Tailwindcss
Could make my life easier, Almost like a ritual, i've been using a huge `.scss` file for my styling containing all the nessacary core classes like .flex_col .muted .subtle .border_box etc. But I think its time to change that. While there's nothing wrong with this, I like to use classes exclusively, and if I need a specific height on a component, i'd rather not need to make a new class. I'd rather just type in something like h_50 and for something to just understand that I want the component to have a height of 50px



#### Learn to use Framer
I've been using figma constantly for the last few years, I heard framer has amazing and more advanced user interactivity in development


#### Learn how to do that cool component child thing I saw once
```html
// From this:
<Component>
    <span class="header" slot="header"> This is the heading of the component</span>
</Component>

// To This:
<Component>
    <Component.Header>This is the heading of the component</Component.Header>
</Component>
```
